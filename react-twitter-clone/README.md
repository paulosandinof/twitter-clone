# React Twitter Clone

A react application for a twitter clone.

This project was part of a one week course from Rockeseat.

This is a web client for the https://github.com/paulosandinof/express-twitter-clone application.

You'll need to put your own IP address in the **baseURL** field of the **services/api** file and on the socket.io connection on the **Timeline** component.

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulosandinof/react-twitter-clone.git
```

- A directory with the name **react-twitter-clone** will be created, access it:

```bash
cd react-twitter-clone
```

- Inside this folder, install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

- Start the application:

```
yarn start
```
